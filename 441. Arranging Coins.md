#441. Arranging Coins

	You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must 
	have exactly k coins.

	Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

算数推导：

第2行：2 <br/ >
.<br/ >

.<br/ >
第n行：n

$ \sum_{\forall i}{x_i^{2}} $

所以如果刚刚填满的话，k (k+1) /2 = n  ---> k $\^2$ + k + 0.25 = 2n + 0.25 --> k = $\sqrt{2n+0.25}$ - 0.5

```csharp

    public int arrangeCoins(int n) { 
       return (int) (Math.sqrt(2*(long)n+0.25) - 0.5); 
    }

```
